# LiveClip dual-profile benchmark v1 Living ExecPlan

Prepared 2026-09-18. This plan follows `.agent/PLANS.md` and uses
`liveclip_dual_profile_benchmark_v1.json` as the machine acceptance contract.

## Purpose / Big Picture

One semantic clipping run must independently execute `short_highlight` and
`mini_lesson`, preserve same-topic short/long variants, validate and cap each
Profile separately, render every eligible continuous interval, and expose an
auditable manifest whose counts are recomputed from final arrays. A fixed
evaluator measures the checked-in 110-minute transcript without leaking its
gold timestamps into production discovery.

## Context and current root cause

The current v12/v13 configuration has exactly one `clip_profile`. Bootstrap,
CLI/API presets and `StageHandlers._candidates` branch on that scalar; the
short and mini implementations therefore never enter the same PipelineRun.
The short path uses semantic-windowed 120/60 discovery and the mini path uses
the historical Topic-Chain route, so the successful short run could not have
executed a second candidate pool. Render output paths are also chosen from the
run-wide scalar Profile and the ordinary Delivery manifest contains clip rows
only, with no requested/executed Profile audit. This is a configuration and
orchestration defect, not merely a score or Prompt defect.

The attached transcript is the checked-in
`tests/fixtures/8-30-full-transcript.srt`, SHA-256
`29b8751643ecc38a7183ab0c837a011cbca1e70a56de0788cd66292dbf364120`.
Existing dirty SD-6 documentation/QA belongs to the user and must be preserved.

## Scope and non-goals

Implement a current dual-profile contract while retaining exact v8--v13
snapshot replay and Algorithm A/B v1 compatibility. Production code may use
only Agent decisions for semantic discovery, completeness and duplicate
relationships. Python may enforce schema, cue/time truth, duration, risk and
quality gates, independent Top-N, cache identity, retries, counting and
rendering. Benchmark time anchors are evaluator/fixture-only and may never be
imported by production modules.

## Work breakdown

1. Freeze existing v8--v13 behavior and add a new immutable config generation
   for `requested_profiles`, per-Profile duration/Top-N controls and prompt
   hashes. Keep the legacy scalar as a replay/compatibility projection only.
2. Add Profile-bearing candidate/final audit models. Every raw candidate must
   terminate in selected, manual, blocked, rejected, same-Profile duplicate or
   Profile-local Top-N exclusion.
3. Preserve short scanning. Add direct mini scanning over 600-second contexts,
   300-second half-open ownership and a deterministic tail window. The Agent
   sees full cues and directly proposes continuous >90--300-second teaching
   units; it does not receive benchmark anchors or short results.
4. Run boundary and Global Review per Profile with appropriate context and
   forbid cross-Profile dedup. Materialize only auto-eligible rows but retain
   manual/blocked/rejected evidence.
5. Namespace cache identity and output paths by Profile. Emit discovery-short,
   discovery-long, boundary, review, final and run-manifest audit artifacts.
6. Implement `scripts/evaluate_benchmark.py` as evaluation-only matching and
   hard-gate reporting.
7. Prove exact boundary behavior, long-window coverage, variant coexistence,
   quality/risk gates, count conservation, cache separation, FFmpeg duration
   support and legacy compatibility with mock providers.
8. Use a new isolated cache/output root for the real transcript run; retain
   Provider telemetry and never claim real PASS without actual calls/artifacts.

The implementation uses a separate `DualProfileRunConfig` and
`run_dual_profile_evaluation` application-service API, exposed by
`liveclip dual-profile-eval`, instead of mutating immutable v8--v13 replay
snapshots or the legacy database candidate schema. The paired render API is
`render_dual_profile_candidates`, exposed by `liveclip dual-profile-render`.
An explicit cross-Profile Variant Link stage changes only group labels and is
unable to score, retime, reject or deduplicate candidates.

## Validation and acceptance

Targeted unit/integration tests must cover all seventeen cases in the user
contract. `make lint` must pass. The benchmark evaluator must exit nonzero on
any hard gate and only report PASS at score >=85 with short >=7/8, long >=5/6,
L01/L02/L03 present, R01/R02 routed, zero automatic hard-quality failures and
fully reconciled raw/final arrays. Required rendered outputs are L01--L03 plus
S06/S07; ffprobe, full decode, SRT bounds, hashes and visual inspection are
recorded separately from semantic scoring. Human audio listening is reported
truthfully.

## Idempotency and recovery

All new semantic cache keys bind source hash, Profile, window range, Prompt
hash, model/settings and schema/algorithm version. Cold benchmark mode points
at a fresh cache root. A failed Provider unit preserves its call evidence and
uses only the existing bounded repair/retry contract. Historical PipelineRun
snapshots remain loadable. Rerunning the evaluator is read-only except for its
two deterministic report files.

## Decisions

- 2026-09-18: treat the scalar run-wide `clip_profile` as the primary root
  cause. Prompt-only changes cannot cause both branches to execute.
- 2026-09-18: replace mini discovery for the new dual contract with direct
  600/300 windows. Retain Topic-Chain v13 for immutable single-mini replay.
- 2026-09-18: keep benchmark matching outside production code and require
  explicit artifact schema validation before scoring.
- 2026-09-18: use a Discovery Coverage Audit to recover omitted contained
  lessons and risk chains. It remains a direct full-context discovery pass,
  not a short-result merger.
- 2026-09-18: use an Agent-only Variant Link pass after both Profile-local
  reviews. Python validates exact candidate coverage and never infers semantic
  relationships from overlap, time containment, keywords or punctuation.
- 2026-09-18: machine evaluation implements the benchmark's explicit
  cue/time semantic-equivalence allowance with a conservative 90% cue and time
  coverage rule; production selection does not use this matcher.
- 2026-09-24: an explicit local “step one is X” restart is a valid initiating
  premise for a multi-step unit even when earlier context contains a broader
  definition. This does not make a recap-only comparison complete; S07 still
  requires the first local weak-mix/breathy-mix premise and definition.
- 2026-09-24: `dual-profile-render` must resolve the configured data directory
  to an absolute forbidden root before source validation, matching the main
  pipeline security boundary.

## Risks and mitigations

The persistent DB currently has no Profile column on candidates. A migration
or exact Profile-bearing persisted metadata is required before one run can
render both types safely; candidate-ID prefixes are not an acceptable source
of truth. Real 110-minute editorial execution may be expensive, so calls must
be bounded, observable and resumable, but the acceptance thresholds may not be
reduced. Existing user changes in STATUS/QA and ignored SD-6 artifacts must not
be overwritten.

## Recovery Notes

Final recovery point: fresh-cache run
`data/evaluations/dual-profile-benchmark-20260924-final-cold-18` is the current
real acceptance evidence. The evaluator reports PASS 90.36 with short 7/8,
mini 5/6, L01/L02/L03 all present, R01/R02 routed, zero automatic hard-quality
failures, both Profiles executed and `cache_hits=0`. Its 228 real calls took
about 4,409 seconds wall time and recorded 6,645,600 input tokens, 626,578
output tokens, 13,321,917 ms summed provider latency, four repair operations
and zero retries. Raw/final conservation is 87/87 short and 105/105 mini.

`renders/` below that run contains seven matched short clips and five matched
mini lessons, all H.264/AAC 1080x1920 via VideoToolbox in one attempt each.
ffprobe duration deltas are 0--20 ms; full decode, black-frame and crop checks
pass, and all 12 contact sheets are recorded `viewed_passed`. The 12 videos
total 1,056,261,573 bytes and 1,218,720 ms. The cut-script handoff is under
`scripts-export/`.

`make lint` passes. The dual-profile targeted suite passes 33/33. Full testing
with `PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH make test` passes 2,495/2,496; the sole
remaining failure is the pre-existing loop-engineering toolchain snapshot test,
which receives macOS `PermissionError` while atomically renaming a temporary
secure-cache directory outside the coder workspace. It is unrelated to the
dual-profile product path and is not hidden as a green full suite.
